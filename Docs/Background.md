I have a personal server on my network that is partially used for archiving video files with the largest majority of files being clips from gameplay. The current total is around 1TB+ with around 700+ video files. With such a large amount of data I wanted to build a solution for organizing, storing and manipulating the videos.

Many of the video file lengths are much longer than needed and may also be at incorrect resolutions, frame rates and bitrates. One goal is to allow mass editing of videos so that only the important portion is held instead of the full video.

Another goal is to ensure that all the videos are stored in a efficient and well organized manner that is still perfectly accessible via a file explorer.
